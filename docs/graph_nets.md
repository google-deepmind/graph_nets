## Other Functions and Classes
### [`class blocks.EdgeBlock`](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets/blob/master/graph_nets/blocks.py?q=class:EdgeBlock)<!-- blocks.EdgeBlock .code-reference -->

Edge block.

A block that updates the features of each edge in a batch of graphs based on
(a subset of) the previous edge features, the features of the adjacent nodes,
and the global features of the corresponding graph.

See https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261 for more details.

#### [`blocks.EdgeBlock.__init__(edge_model_fn, use_edges=True, use_receiver_nodes=True, use_sender_nodes=True, use_globals=True, name='edge_block')`](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets/blob/master/graph_nets/blocks.py?l=379)<!-- blocks.EdgeBlock.__init__ .code-reference -->

Initializes the EdgeBlock module.

##### Args:


* `edge_model_fn`: A callable that will be called in the variable scope of
    this EdgeBlock and should return a Sonnet module (or equivalent
    callable) to be used as the edge model. The returned module should take
    a `Tensor` (of concatenated input features for each edge) and return a
    `Tensor` (of output features for each edge). Typically, this module
    would input and output `Tensor`s of rank 2, but it may also be input or
    output larger ranks. See the `_build` method documentation for more
    details on the acceptable inputs to this module in that case.
* `use_edges`: (bool, default=True). Whether to condition on edge attributes.
* `use_receiver_nodes`: (bool, default=True). Whether to condition on receiver
    node attributes.
* `use_sender_nodes`: (bool, default=True). Whether to condition on sender
    node attributes.
* `use_globals`: (bool, default=True). Whether to condition on global
    attributes.
* `name`: The module name.

##### Raises:


* `ValueError`: When fields that are required are missing.


#### [`blocks.EdgeBlock.__call__(graph)`](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets/blob/master/graph_nets/blocks.py?l=423)<!-- blocks.EdgeBlock.__call__ .code-reference -->

Connects the edge block.

##### Args:


* `graph`: A `graphs.GraphsTuple` containing `Tensor`s, whose individual edges
    features (if `use_edges` is `True`), individual nodes features (if
    `use_receiver_nodes` or `use_sender_nodes` is `True`) and per graph
    globals (if `use_globals` is `True`) should be concatenable on the last
    axis.

##### Returns:

  An output `graphs.GraphsTuple` with updated edges.

##### Raises:


* `ValueError`: If `graph` does not have non-`None` receivers and senders, or
    if `graph` has `None` fields incompatible with the selected `use_edges`,
    `use_receiver_nodes`, `use_sender_nodes`, or `use_globals` options.

See the documentation for `AbstractModule._capture_variables()` for more
information about what variables are captured.

##### Returns:

  A sorted (by variable name) tuple of `tf.Variable` objects.

connection is to get the post-uniquification name, which we support using
the separate .scope_name property.

feature vectors per graph) to give per-graph features (one feature
vector per graph). The reducer should take a `Tensor` of edge features, a
`Tensor` of segment indices, and a number of graphs. It should be invariant
under permutation of edge features within each graph.

Examples of compatible reducers are:

### [`class blocks.NodeBlock`](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets/blob/master/graph_nets/blocks.py?q=class:NodeBlock)<!-- blocks.NodeBlock .code-reference -->

Node block.

A block that updates the features of each node in batch of graphs based on
(a subset of) the previous node features, the aggregated features of the
adjacent edges, and the global features of the corresponding graph.

See https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261 for more details.

#### [`blocks.NodeBlock.__init__(node_model_fn, use_received_edges=True, use_sent_edges=False, use_nodes=True, use_globals=True, received_edges_reducer=<function unsorted_segment_sum>, sent_edges_reducer=<function unsorted_segment_sum>, name='node_block')`](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets/blob/master/graph_nets/blocks.py?l=474)<!-- blocks.NodeBlock.__init__ .code-reference -->

Initializes the NodeBlock module.

##### Args:


* `node_model_fn`: A callable that will be called in the variable scope of
    this NodeBlock and should return a Sonnet module (or equivalent
    callable) to be used as the node model. The returned module should take
    a `Tensor` (of concatenated input features for each node) and return a
    `Tensor` (of output features for each node). Typically, this module
    would input and output `Tensor`s of rank 2, but it may also be input or
    output larger ranks. See the `_build` method documentation for more
    details on the acceptable inputs to this module in that case.
* `use_received_edges`: (bool, default=True) Whether to condition on
    aggregated edges received by each node.
* `use_sent_edges`: (bool, default=False) Whether to condition on aggregated
    edges sent by each node.
* `use_nodes`: (bool, default=True) Whether to condition on node attributes.
* `use_globals`: (bool, default=True) Whether to condition on global
    attributes.
* `received_edges_reducer`: Reduction to be used when aggregating received
    edges. This should be a callable whose signature matches
    `tf.math.unsorted_segment_sum`.
* `sent_edges_reducer`: Reduction to be used when aggregating sent edges.
    This should be a callable whose signature matches
    `tf.math.unsorted_segment_sum`.

Constructor.

The reducer is used for combining per-edge features (one set of edge
feature vectors per node) to give per-node features (one feature
vector per node). The reducer should take a `Tensor` of edge features, a
`Tensor` of segment indices, and a number of nodes. It should be invariant
under permutation of edge features within each segment.

Examples of compatible reducers are:
* tf.math.unsorted_segment_sum
* tf.math.unsorted_segment_mean
* tf.math.unsorted_segment_prod
* unsorted_segment_min_or_zero
* unsorted_segment_max_or_zero

### [`class modules.CommNet`](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets/blob/master/graph_nets/modules.py?q=class:CommNet)<!-- modules.CommNet .code-reference -->

CommNet module.

Implementation for the model originally described in
https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07736 (S. Sukhbaatar, A. Szlam, R. Fergus), in the
version presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06122 (Y. Hoshen).

This module internally creates edge features based on the features from the
nodes sending to that edge, and independently learns an embedding for each
node. It then uses these edges and nodes features to compute updated node
features.

This module does not use the global nor the edges features of the input, but
uses its receivers and senders information. The output graph has the same
value in edge and global fields as the input graph. The edge and global
features fields may have a `None` value in the input `gn_graphs.GraphsTuple`.

    by `edge_model_fn`, but for the first and last dimension.
* `node_model_fn`: A callable to be passed to NodeBlock. The callable must
    return a Sonnet module (or equivalent; see NodeBlock for details).

edges. The nodes features are first updated based on their value and the
globals features, and new globals features are then computed based on the
updated nodes features.

Note that in the original model, only the globals are updated in the returned
graph, while this implementation also returns updated nodes.
The original model can be reproduced by writing:
```
deep_sets = DeepSets()
output = deep_sets(input)
output = input.replace(globals=output.globals)
```

This module does not use the edges data or the information contained in the
receivers or senders; the output graph has the same value in those fields as
the input graph. Those fields can also have `None` values in the input
`graphs.GraphsTuple`.

edges. It then updates the nodes based on the incomming updated edges.
See https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00222 for more details.

This model does not update the graph globals, and they are allowed to be
`None`.

### [`class modules.SelfAttention`](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets/blob/master/graph_nets/modules.py?q=class:SelfAttention)<!-- modules.SelfAttention .code-reference -->

Multi-head self-attention module.

The module is based on the following three papers:
 * A simple neural network module for relational reasoning (RNs):
     https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01427
 * Non-local Neural Networks: https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07971.
 * Attention Is All You Need (AIAYN): https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762.

The input to the modules consists of a graph containing values for each node
and connectivity between them, a tensor containing keys for each node
and a tensor containing queries for each node.

The self-attention step consist of updating the node values, with each new
node value computed in a two step process:
- Computing the attention weights between each node and all of its senders
 nodes, by calculating sum(sender_key*receiver_query) and using the softmax
 operation on all attention weights for each node.
- For each receiver node, compute the new node value as the weighted average
 of the values of the sender nodes, according to the attention weights.
- Nodes with no received edges, get an updated value of 0.

Values, keys and queries contain a "head" axis to compute independent
self-attention for each of the heads.

#### [`modules.SelfAttention.__init__(name='self_attention')`](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets/blob/master/graph_nets/modules.py?l=622)<!-- modules.SelfAttention.__init__ .code-reference -->

Connects the multi-head self-attention module.

The self-attention is only computed according to the connectivity of the
input graphs, with receiver nodes attending to sender nodes.

##### Args:

    The expected shape is [total_num_nodes, num_heads, key_size].
* `node_keys`: Tensor containing the key associated to each of the nodes. The
    expected shape is [total_num_nodes, num_heads, key_size].
* `node_queries`: Tensor containing the query associated to each of the nodes.
    The expected shape is [total_num_nodes, num_heads, query_size]. The
    query size must be equal to the key size.
* `attention_graph`: Graph containing connectivity information between nodes
    via the senders and receivers fields. Node A will only attempt to attend
    to Node B if `attention_graph` contains an edge sent by Node A and
    received by Node B.

  "features" key. If the `NODES` fields is `None`, a `None` value is placed
  here;

- If the `RECEIVERS` field is `None`, no edges are added to the graph.
  Otherwise, edges are added with the order in which they appeared in
  `data_dict` stored in the "index" field of their attributes dictionary;

- The edges features are placed in the edges attribute dictionary under the
  "features" key. If the `EDGES` field is `None`, a `None` value is placed;

- The global feature are placed under the key "features" of the graph
  property of the returned instance. If the `GLOBALS` field is `None`, a
  `None` global property is created.

### [`utils_tf.concat(input_graphs, axis, name='graph_concat')`](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets/blob/master/graph_nets/utils_tf.py?l=351)<!-- utils_tf.concat .code-reference -->

Returns an op that concatenates graphs along a given axis.

In all cases, the NODES, EDGES and GLOBALS dimension are concatenated
along `axis` (if a fields is `None`, the concatenation is just a `None`).
If `axis` == 0, then the graphs are concatenated along the (underlying) batch
dimension, i.e. the RECEIVERS, SENDERS, N_NODE and N_EDGE fields of the tuples
are also concatenated together.
If `axis` != 0, then there is an underlying asumption that the receivers,
SENDERS, N_NODE and N_EDGE fields of the graphs in `values` should all match,
but this is not checked by this op.
The graphs in `input_graphs` should have the same set of keys for which the
corresponding fields is not `None`.

##### Args:


* `input_graphs`: A list of `graphs.GraphsTuple` objects containing `Tensor`s
    and satisfying the constraints outlined above.
* `axis`: An axis to concatenate on.

Creates a `graphs.GraphsTuple` containing tensors from data dicts.

 All dictionaries must have exactly the same set of keys with non-`None`
 values associated to them. Moreover, this set of this key must define a valid
 graph (i.e. if the `EDGES` are `None`, the `SENDERS` and `RECEIVERS` must be
 `None`, and `SENDERS` and `RECEIVERS` can only be `None` both at the same
 time). The values associated with a key must be convertible to `Tensor`s,
 for instance python lists, numpy arrays, or Tensorflow `Tensor`s.

 This method may perform a memory copy.

 The `RECEIVERS`, `SENDERS`, `N_NODE` and `N_EDGE` fields are cast to
 `np.int32` type.

##### Args:


* `data_dicts`: An iterable of data dictionaries with keys in `ALL_FIELDS`.
* `name`: (string, optional) A name for the operation.

##### Returns:

  A `graphs.GraphTuple` representing the graphs in `data_dicts`.

Adds edges to a graph by fully-connecting the nodes.

This method does not require the number of nodes per graph to be constant,
or to be known at graph building time.

##### Args:


* `graph`: A `graphs.GraphsTuple` with `None` values for the edges, senders and
    receivers.
  exclude_self_edges (default=False): Excludes self-connected edges.

* `name`: (string, optional) A name for the operation.

##### Returns:

  A `graphs.GraphsTuple` containing `Tensor`s with fully-connected edges.

##### Raises:


* `ValueError`: if any of the `EDGES`, `RECEIVERS` or `SENDERS` field is not
    `None` in `graph`.


### [`utils_tf.fully_connect_graph_static(graph, exclude_self_edges=False, name='fully_connect_graph_static')`](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets/blob/master/graph_nets/utils_tf.py?l=686)<!-- utils_tf.fully_connect_graph_static .code-reference -->

Adds edges to a graph by fully-connecting the nodes.

This method can be used if the number of nodes for each graph in `graph` is
constant and known at graph building time: it will be inferred by dividing
the number of nodes in the batch(the length of `graph.nodes`) by the number of
graphs in the batch (the length of `graph.n_node`). It is an error to call
this method with batches of graphs with dynamic or uneven sizes; in the latter
case, the method may silently yield an incorrect result.

##### Args:


* `graph`: A `graphs.GraphsTuple` with `None` values for the edges, senders and
    receivers.
  exclude_self_edges (default=False): Excludes self-connected edges.

* `name`: (string, optional) A name for the operation.

##### Returns:

  A `graphs.GraphsTuple` containing `Tensor`s with fully-connected edges.

##### Raises:


* `ValueError`: If any of the `EDGES`, `RECEIVERS` or `SENDERS` field is not
    `None` in `graph`.
* `ValueError`: If the number of graphs (extracted from `graph.n_node` leading
    dimension) or number of nodes (extracted from `graph.nodes` leading
    dimension) is not known at construction time, or if the latter does not
    divide the former (observe that this is only a necessary condition for
    the constantness of the number of nodes per graph).


### [`utils_tf.get_feed_dict(placeholders, graph)`](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets/blob/master/graph_nets/utils_tf.py?l=218)<!-- utils_tf.get_feed_dict .code-reference -->

Feeds a `graphs.GraphsTuple` of numpy arrays or `None` into `placeholders`.

When feeding a fully defined graph (no `None` field) into a session, this
method is not necessary as one can directly do:

```
_ = sess.run(_, {placeholders: graph})
```

However, if the placeholders contain `None`, the above construction would
fail. This method allows to replace the above call by

```
_ = sess.run(_, get_feed_dict(placeholders: graph))
```

restoring the correct behavior.

##### Args:


* `placeholders`: A `graphs.GraphsTuple` containing placeholders.
* `graph`: A `graphs.GraphsTuple` containing placeholder compatibale values,
    or `None`s.

##### Returns:

  A dictionary with key placeholders and values the fed in values.

* `ValueError`: If the `None` fields in placeholders and `graph` do not exactly
    match.

##### Args:


* `input_graphs`: A `graphs.GraphsTuple` containing `Tensor`s.
* `index`: An `int`, a `slice`, a tensor `int` or a tensor `slice`, to index
    into `graph`. `index` should be compatible with the number of graphs in
    `graphs`. The `step` parameter of the `slice` objects must be None.
* `name`: (string, optional) A name for the operation.

##### Returns:

  A `graphs.GraphsTuple` containing `Tensor`s, made of the extracted
    graph(s).

##### Raises:


* `TypeError`: if `index` is not an `int`, a `slice`, or corresponding tensor
    types.

##### Args:


* `graph`: A `graphs.GraphsTuple` containing `Tensor`s. `None` values are passed
    through.
* `name`: (string, optional) A name for the operation.

##### Returns:

  A `graphs.GraphsTuple` `graphs_output` such that for any field `x` in NODES,
  EDGES, GLOBALS, RECEIVERS, SENDERS, N_NODE, N_EDGE, if `graph.x` was
  `None`, `graph_output.x` is `None`, and otherwise
  `graph_output.x = tf.identity(graph.x)`


### [`utils_tf.make_runnable_in_session(graph, name='make_graph_runnable_in_session')`](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets/blob/master/graph_nets/utils_tf.py?l=489)<!-- utils_tf.make_runnable_in_session .code-reference -->

Allows a graph containing `None` fields to be run in a `tf.Session`.

The `None` values of `graph` are replaced by `tf.no_op()`. This function is
