This is used for keeping track of which nodes and edges belong to which graph, so they can be split up later, and so the graph can broadcast a graph's global attributes across its nodes and edges.\n",
        "3. It adds an integer offset to the sender and receiver indices, which corresponds to the number of nodes in the preceding graphs. This allows the indices to correspond to the nodes and edges of their corresponding graph, after the node and edge attributes have been concatenated.\n",
